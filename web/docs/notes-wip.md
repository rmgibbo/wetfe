## Going Pure
  
Jaded, powerful beings may end their existence in the Confluent Realm by _going pure_: an irreversible process (akin to an ER wormhole journey) whereby they commit to exist as a denizen of another realm. Typically, the being becomes disillusioned with their existence in their own realm, and attempts to transcend it by permanently transferring their soul to another, to which they feel a strong affinity.
  
## Relics & Fonts
  
The process of going pure encodes the quantum information of the being in mass-energy structures known as holographs.  Holo Hunters are (typically groups of) beings that make a living searching the cosmos for these holographic remnants of transcended beings. Once located, artisans called _reifiers_, or _soulcrafters_, attempt to reify (via a process known as _reification_) the holograph into soul reliquiae, which are commonly known as _relics_. These relics are powerful items that harbor vestigial information -- and thus powers -- of their progenitor. These vessels of power within the relics are commonly called _fonts_, and are what makes them (potentially supremely) valuable.
  
## Soulbinding
  
Beings that acquire relics may innervate the fonts within them with quanta of their own soul in a process called _soulbinding_. Soulbound relics are potent sources of power, and are prized by adventurers, warmongers, academics, collectors, etc., alike. Merchants that deal in lesser relics (on the the Holo Market, or Soul Relic Trade, "SRT") are known as _soulmongers_; or as _purveyors_ if they deal in the rare, coveted variety.
