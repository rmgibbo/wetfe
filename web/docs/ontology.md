# Terms
  
_thing_  
: Anything eligible for existence, in the broadest sense. Zero-dimensional points, second-order logic systems, biological evolution, a God that cannot move its own creation, non-trivial factorizations of prime numbers, etc., are all _things_.  
: _TODO: More formally, this may be defined as all permutations of the characters of the alphabet of some suitably universal language._
  
_**g<sub>s</sub>**_  
: An instance of some _thing_, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
logical self-consistence  
: A property that every _thing_ either has, or does not have. This is not a decidable property, in general, with extant Human theory.
  
`Thing`  
: A logically self-consistent _thing_.
  
__T<sub>s</sub>__  
: An instance of some `Thing`, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
Reality  
: A partitionable container of _things_.
  
existence  
: A _thing_ exists iff Reality contains it.  
: Reality contains a _thing_ iff it exists.
  
existential proposition, `EXP`  
: Any proposition of a _thing_ _**g**_ that comprehensively implies that _**g**_ exists when it is true, and that _**g**_ does not exist when it is false.
  
∃(_**g<sub>s</sub>**_  )  
: The existential proposition of some _thing **g<sub>s</sub>**_  .
  
∃(__T<sub>s</sub>__)  
: The existential proposition of some `Thing` __T<sub>s</sub>__.
  
`Realm`  
: Some partition of Reality, which contains zero or more (likely uncountably infinite) number of existential propositions and `Things`.
  
# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Every _thing_ that exists by implication of a true existential proposition is a `Thing`.
- The existential proposition of a `Thing` is a `Thing`.
  
### [2] Principle of Auto-Instantiation
  
- An existential proposition exists for every _thing_.
- ~~Every extant `Thing` __T__ instantiates an existential proposition for each extant `Thing`, _for each extant `Thing`_.~~
- ~~These auto-instantiated propositions are of the form _"There exists a relationship of type **T<sub>j</sub>** between **T** and **T<sub>i</sub>**."_, where the indexed __Ts__ range over the entire space of extant `Things` (including __T__ itself).~~ 
  
### [3] Principle of Unbiased Implications
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is (somewhere) true _**and**_ (somewhere) false. Every other proposition is (everywhere) false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the space of all existential propositions and their implications in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Exposition
  
`Thing` encompasses "Platonic" concepts such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" concepts such as a photon, or a cat; and "meta-physical" concepts, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such _things_ are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it is contradictory in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is everywhere false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is unknown.
  
In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some _thing_, within some `Realm`.
(For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in an empty subspace of Reality, but this is not a necessary assumption.)
  
### __T<sub>0</sub>__
  
We may first consider the `EXP` _"This existential proposition exists."_
  
(Note that this is equivalent to _"An existential proposition of itself exists."_)
  
By [2] or [4], we know that the _thing_ ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists.
  
Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition _**g<sub>0</sub>**_, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = _**g<sub>0</sub>**_ = ∃(_**g<sub>0</sub>**_).
  
Now, because _**g<sub>0</sub>**_ exists, ∃(_**g<sub>0</sub>**_) is somewhere true, and therefore by [3], ∃(_**g<sub>0</sub>**_) = _**g<sub>0</sub>**_ is a `Thing`.
  
We should now call it ∃(∃(∃(...))) = __T<sub>0</sub>__ = ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__).
  
### Reality Is Not a `Thing`
Reality is not logically self-consistent since it contains contradictory states (existence and nonexistence) of every `Thing` in it.  (Equivalently, it contains contradictory truth assignments for every logically self-consistent existential proposition.)
  
Therefore, Reality is not a `Thing`; ∃(_**g<sub>Reality</sub>**_) is everywhere false; and it does not contain itself. And, sensationally, Reality does not exist. Of course, it does in a primal sense, but not in the sense used here, which would require that Reality contains itself.
  
(This is perhaps a good time to point out that this "axiomatization of Reality" makes no attempt to explain _why_ or _how_ Reality does exist. Nor, even, how the crux of it works -- how the "logically self-consistent" property is crucially applied to the subset of _things_, to produce what we here call `Things`. Perhaps one day we will know, but for now the thrill of discovery and pursuit of explanation must suffice.)

# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinitely partitionable space of propositions and their implications.
- Every `Thing` exists. _TODO ^_
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on the underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
