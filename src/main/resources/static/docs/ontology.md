# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Let `Thing` mean any logically self-consistent _thing_, where _thing_ is taken as broadly as possible.
- An existential proposition of a _thing_ __g__ implies, comprehensively, that __g__ exists in the case that it (the proposition) is true, and that __g__ does not exist in the case that it (the proposition) is false.
  
### [2] Principle of Auto-Instantiation
  
- This existential proposition is a `Thing`, which exists.
- Every extant `Thing` __T__ instantiates an existential proposition for each extant `Thing`, _for each extant `Thing`_.
- These auto-instantiated propositions are of the form _"There exists a relationship of type **T<sub>j</sub>** between **T** and **T<sub>i</sub>**"_, where the indexed __Ts__ range over the entire set of extant `Things` (including __T__ itself). 
  
### [3] Principle of Unbiased Implications
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is (somewhere) true _**and**_ (somewhere) false. Every other proposition is (everywhere) false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the space of all propositions, and their implications in accordance with [3] and [2].
  
# Exposition
  
- Let the string `Thing` mean any logically self-consistent thing, where "thing" is taken as broadly as possible.
  
Here, `Thing` encompasses "Platonic" concepts such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" concepts such as a proton, or a cat; and "meta-physical" concepts, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such things are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it does not make sense in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an inconsistent existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is everywhere false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is, in principle, unobtainable.
  
- Let __T<sub>s</sub>__ mean some instance of a `Thing`, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T<sub>i</sub>__, within some arbitrary subspace of Reality. 
Here, either no other thing exists, or an arbitrary number of other things exist. 
For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in the former case, but this is not a necessary assumption.
  
- Let `universe` mean some such subspace of Reality.
  
- Let ∃(__T__) indicate the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T__.

### ∃(T<sub>i</sub>) ∧ ∃(T<sub>j</sub>) ∧ ∃(T<sub>k</sub>) &rarr;
  
1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>i</sub>__
    1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
        1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
        2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
    2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
        1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
        2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>i</sub>__
    1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
        1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
        2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
    2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
        1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
        2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>k</sub>__
  
- Here, we've considered three existential propositions, and can see the structure of Reality that they, together, imply.  
- The subspace of Reality corresponding to 1.1.1. contains (at least) three extant Things.
- Note that the 1.1.1. subspace is exactly one eighth of the total combinatorial space implied by the three propositions, but it is also the _densest_, in the sense that it contains more extant Things than any of the other seven subspaces.  
- As an example, we may take __T<sub>i</sub>__ and __T<sub>j</sub>__ to be points within some geometry, and __T<sub>k</sub>__ to be the number one.

# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinitely divisible space of propositions and their implications.
- Every logically possible `Thing` exists. _TODO ^_
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on the underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
