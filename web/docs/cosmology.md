# Intro
  
### Child Cosmos
  
Reality: A mind-numbingly vast and alien domain, teeming with an infinite variety of subspaces, or universes. Some exceedingly rich subspaces of Reality permit phenomena, and even physics, to emerge from components of different universes. Within one such subspace, three cosmoses are strongly interacting with each other. And of this confluence, a new cosmos has been wrought. It is a child cosmos, born of an eclectic, supremely unlikely, yet cohesive mixture of its parents’ properties...
  
### Celestial Realm
  
From one of its cosmic parents, known to some as the Bitsphere, or the Celestial Realm, it inherits the geometry of its three spatial dimensions; and the invariant mass field that permeates it. Thus, it is equipped with the structures that admit highly distinct regions of matter-space, and therefore vast amounts of information.
  
### Infernal Realm
  
From another parent cosmos, known to some as the Chronosphere, or the Infernal Realm, it acquires the geometry of its temporal dimension, and of its prime consequences, the Arrow of Time, manifest in asymmetric thermodynamic processes. Thus the systems of mass-energy within the child cosmos inexorably climb to ever-higher entropy states, thereby obscuring information and driving the macrocosm toward thermal equilibrium.
  
### Exotic Realm
  
From its final cosmic progenitor, known to some as the Queersphere, or the Exotic Realm, it acquires its quantum and multiversal nature: the spacetime manifold and stress-energy-momentum tensor begotten of the mixture between the Celestial and Infernal Realms are quantized, and "smeared" across an infinity of loosely-coupled parallel dimensions.  
  
### Confluent Realm
Thus formed, the child cosmos is imbued with the ingredients necessary to exhibit an infinity of emergent physics and phenomena. And so they did emerge: particles, gravity, chemistry, biology, intelligence; and eventually consciousness, which gradually became aware of these phenomena; and then of the universe itself; and then even of its progenitors...
  
# ~NOTES~
  
### Going Pure
  
Jaded/enlightening/learned/fatalistic/powerful/worldly beings may end their existence in the Confluent Realm by “Going Pure”: an irreversible process (blackhole/wormhole journey) whereby they commit to “live” as a denizen of another Realm. Typically: the being becomes disillusioned with their existence in their own universe, and attempts to transcend it by permanently transferring their soul to another universe, to which they feel a strong affinity.
  
### Relics & Fonts
  
The process of going pure distributes/imprints/encodes the being’s (quantum) information in (2D) mass/energy structures known as Holographs.  Holo Hunters are (typically groups of) beings that make a living searching the universe for these Holographic remnants of the “transcended”. Once located, artisans (“Reifiers”, “Soulcrafters”) attempt to reify (via “Reification”) the Holograph into Soul Reliquiae/Relics. These Relics are powerful items that harbor vestigial energy/essence/powers of their progenitor. These vessels of power within the Relics are commonly called Fonts, and are what makes them (potentially supremely) valuable.
  
### Soulbinding
  
Beings that acquire Relics may innervate the Fonts within them with quanta of their own soul in a process called Soulbinding. Soulbound Relics are potent sources of power, and are prized by adventurers, warmongers, academics, collectors, etc. alike. Merchants that deal in common Relics (on the “The SRT”, “Soul Relic Trade/Index”, “The Holo Market”) are known as “Soulmongers”; or “Purveyors” if they deal in the rare, coveted variety.
