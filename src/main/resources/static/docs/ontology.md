# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Let `Thing` mean any logically self-consistent _thing_, where _thing_ is taken as broadly as possible.
- An existential proposition of a _thing_ _**g**_ implies, comprehensively, that _**g**_ exists in the case that it (the proposition) is true, and that _**g**_ does not exist in the case that it (the proposition) is false.
- The existential proposition of a `Thing` is a `Thing`.
- This existential proposition exists.
  
### [2] Principle of Auto-Instantiation
  
- Every extant `Thing` __T__ instantiates an existential proposition for each extant `Thing`, _for each extant `Thing`_.
- These auto-instantiated propositions are of the form _"There exists a relationship of type **T<sub>j</sub>** between **T** and **T<sub>i</sub>**."_, where the indexed __Ts__ range over the entire space of extant `Things` (including __T__ itself). 
  
### [3] Principle of Unbiased Implications
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is (somewhere) true _**and**_ (somewhere) false. Every other proposition is (everywhere) false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the space of all propositions, and their implications in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Exposition
  
- Let `Thing` mean any logically self-consistent _thing_, where _thing_ is taken as broadly as possible.
  
Here, `Thing` encompasses "Platonic" concepts such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" concepts such as a proton, or a cat; and "meta-physical" concepts, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such _things_ are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it does not make sense in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is everywhere false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is, in principle, unobtainable.
  
- Let __T<sub>s</sub>__ mean some instance of a `Thing`, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T<sub>s</sub>__, within some arbitrary subspace of Reality. 
Here, either no other _thing_ exists, or an arbitrary (likely uncountably infinite) number of other _things_ exist. 
For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in the former case, but this is not a necessary assumption.
  
- Let `universe` mean some such subspace of Reality.
- Let ∃(_**g**_) indicate the existential proposition of some _thing **g**_.
- Let ∃(__T__) indicate the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T__.
  
_TODO: {_
  
### __T<sub>0</sub>__
From [1] we have _"This existential propostion exists."_
  
(We may note that this is equivalent to _"An existential proposition of itself exists."_)
  
Thus, we know that the _thing_ ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists, because Reality contains all propositions. Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition _**e0**_, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = _**e0**_ = ∃(_**e0**_).
  
Now by [3], because _**e0**_ exists, ∃(_**e0**_) is somewhere true, and therefore ∃(_**e0**_) = _**e0**_ is a `Thing`.
  
We should now call it ∃(∃(∃(...))) = __T<sub>0</sub>__ = ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__).
  
### ∃(T<sub>i</sub>) ∧ ∃(T<sub>j</sub>) &rarr;
  
1. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>i</sub>__
2. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>i</sub>__
3. Reality contains the existence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
4. Reality contains the nonexistence of __T<sub>j</sub>__
5. Reality contains ∃(_**iii**_), where _**iii**_ is _a **T<sub>i</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>i</sub>** and **T<sub>i</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**iji**_), where _**iji**_ is _a **T<sub>j</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>i</sub>** and **T<sub>i</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**iij**_), where _**iij**_ is _a **T<sub>i</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>i</sub>** and **T<sub>j</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**ijj**_), where _**ijj**_ is _a **T<sub>j</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>i</sub>** and **T<sub>j</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**jii**_), where _**jii**_ is _a **T<sub>i</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>j</sub>** and **T<sub>i</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**jji**_), where _**jji**_ is _a **T<sub>j</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>j</sub>** and **T<sub>i</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**jij**_), where _**jij**_ is _a **T<sub>i</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>j</sub>** and **T<sub>j</sub>**_
5. Reality contains ∃(_**jjj**_), where _**jjj**_ is _a **T<sub>j</sub>** relationship between **T<sub>j</sub>** and **T<sub>j</sub>**_
13. Iff _**iii**_ is a `Thing` &rarr; Reality contains __T<sub>iii</sub>__
    13. ... and all relation permutations between all extant `Things`, including __T<sub>iii</sub>__
14. Iff _**iji**_ is a `Thing` ...
    14. ...
15. ...
    
### In General
  
1. Reality contains all (extant?) propositions.
2. Reality contains the existence _**and nonexistence**_ of all `Things` implicated by existential propositions.
3. 

  
_TODO: }_
  
### TODO
  
# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinitely partitionable space of propositions and their implications.
- Every `Thing` exists. _TODO ^_
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on the underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
