# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Every `Thing`, such as this sentence, exists.
  
### [2] Principle of Existential Logic
  
- Every `Thing` is the implication of an existential proposition.
  
### [3] Principle of Non-Exclusive Implication
  
- Every existential proposition is true **and** false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the exclusive space of all `Things` in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Terms
  
concept, **c**  
: Anything whose existence is proposed, in the broadest sense. Zero-dimensional points, second-order logic systems, biological evolution, a God that can/not move its own creation, non-trivial factorizations of prime numbers, etc., are all concepts.  
  
`Thing`, **T**  
: Anything that exists (including all concepts).
  
existence  
: The state of being within Reality. This is true of something iff it is a `Thing`.
  
existential proposition  
: The proposition of a concept **c** that comprehensively implies that **c** exists if true, and that **c** does not exist if false.
  
∃(**c**), ∃(**T**)  
: The existential proposition of some concept **c**, or some `Thing` **T**.
  
`Realm`  
: Any subspace of Reality, which contains zero or more `Things`.
  
# Exposition
  
### Reality, The Thing?
  
The relationship that Reality has with itself is unclear. We could take Reality to _not_ be a `Thing`, and "exist" in some sense other than our working definition. Or, we could take Reality to be a `Thing` that is like a subset is to itself, or to be a `Thing` that is within Reality like any other `Thing`; and in any case we would be consistent with the axioms given here.
  
Accordingly, this axiomatization makes no attempt to explain why or how Reality does exist. Instead, it attempts to provide a framework for explaining how the human mind (and any other `Thing` possessing similar consciousness) has gained a foothold in Reality, whence it may start exploring its environment more efficiently than by tripping over stones.
  
### Things vs Concepts
  
All concepts are `Things`. Still, the distinction between the two is useful for two reasons.
  
First, concepts appeal to the human-like perception of `Things`. While all `Things` and only `Things` exist, including anything our minds may conjure up, concepts are the `Things` that they have conjured up -- or rather, discovered.
  
Second, concepts are always a permutation of symbols, but only _may_ have a particular meaning. And it is the symbols and their permutations that certainly exist, and therefore why all concepts are `Things`. However, we're rarely interested in the permutations of symbols themselves when we form existential propositions of them.
  
What we're really after is the existence of our meaning of the symbols.
  
So what does it mean, for symbols to _have our meaning?_
  
First of all, it is important to note that whatever these meanings are that concepts may have, they are nothing mystical, and nothing uniquely anthropomorphic. They are simply `Things` in Reality, like everything else. Specifically, they are a subspace of `Things` that are more or less intimately related to the symbol-`Things` of the concept as proposed.
  
Meaningful concepts, then, are rich subspaces of related `Things`, where the "connections" between them are also `Things`.
  
On the other hand, if some concept we have in mind is not very meaningful, then it exists relatively "alone" in Reality, with few other `Things` connected to it.
  
Thus, concepts encompass Platonic entities such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and physical entities such as a photon, or a cat; and meta-physical entities such as aesthetics, or economics; and all of these are `Things`. And they all have a sort of meaningfulness metric, related to how highly connected they are to other `Things`.
  
For example, the concept of _the non-trivial factorization of a prime number_ is unlikely to be very meaningful, since it is contradictory in its own terms. Therefore, "The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists." is an existential proposition of a concept that exists like any other `Thing`, but likely as a mere permutation of symbols in a sparsely-connected corner of Reality.
  
(I suspect that even "sparsely-connected" `Things` are related to an uncountable infinity of other `Things`. The full theory of infinite cardinals/ordinals should be necessary, at least, to begin explaining the connectedness of `Things` within Reality.)
  
### Recursion
  
We may consider the existential proposition "The existential proposition of itself exists."
  
By [1], ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists; and by [2], it has the standard meaning.
  
Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition **T<sub>0</sub>**, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = **T<sub>0</sub>** = ∃(**T<sub>0</sub>**).
  
This construction holds for the symbols and their (standard) meanings, and is consistent with the axioms. In fact, [2] requires that every `Thing` and its existential proposition expand into an infinite composition like so, though only ∃(**T<sub>0</sub>**) is completely self-similar.
  
We might note that Reality seems to brook the concepts of _recursion,_ _equality,_ and _infinity;_ and we may wonder how highly-connected each of these `Things` is...
  
### The Primicorn
  
Let **c<sub>Primicorn</sub>** denote the concept of _the non-trivial factorization of a prime number._
  
Now, we may consider ∃(**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**), which says "The non-trivial factorization of a prime number exists."
  
By [1], ∃(**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**) exists; and by [2], it has the standard meaning.
  
Then by [3], ∃(**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**) is true, at least somewhere in Reality, and _poof!_ it seems we've summoned a Primicorn.
  
Unfortunately, although Primicorns may exist, this "summoning" is not what it seems, for two reasons.
  
First, if Primicorns exist as we mean here, then they -- like all `Things` -- can be discovered, not summoned.
  
Second, the fact that ∃(**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**) is true does not imply that a particular meaning of **c<sub>Primicorn</sub>** exists.
  
It implies that somewhere within Reality the string _the non-trivial factorization of a prime number_ exists. In this case, it's likely sparsely connected to other `Things`.
  
### The Primicorn, Again
  
Perhaps we have a friend who insists that Primicorns exist.
  
"I have a Primicorn in mind right now, and it makes complete sense!" they might say. We may even take them at their word and assume that they do have a convincing concept in mind. How can we be sure that Primicorns, in fact, do not exist?

We cannot. We cannot, whether or not we have a friend strongly advocating for their existence.

All the axioms tell us is:

- **If** the proposed concept of a Primicorn is a `Thing` highly connected to other `Things`, then our friend has discovered a concept of richer meaning than the ordered symbols that they used to represent it.
- **Otherwise**, our friend has a vague concept in mind, perhaps little more than an arbitrary permutation of symbols, which does exist, but is unlikely to be useful in deeper explanations of Reality.
  
The fundamental issue is that we have no general method of determining how meaningful concepts are a priori. And then, even if we were so equipped, we have no general method of determining what the nature and extent of our `Realm` is, again a priori. In both cases, however, propositions of concepts (i.e. theories), critique, and experimentation shall avail us.
  
### Communication
  
We must be careful to distinguish what are essentially communication issues between various minds probing Reality from within, and "mis-interpretations" made by Reality itself.
  
Crucially, the former class of problems is ubiquitous (for humans at least), and the latter is a fallacy.
  
Let's summon the Primicorn yet again, and suppose our friend is still fervently advocating for its veracity. This time they bring a pencil to the proverbial table.
  
"Look," they say, as they sketch a remarkable proof that P is clearly not NP -- but it hinges on the existence of a Primicorn. At this, we are reflexively tempted to declare it a neat line of logic that is hopelessly lost by false assumptions. But, caught up in their excitement, we instead re-examine the Primicorn, there in the crux of the proof.
  
We notice it's presented exactly as we'd expect -- as what we both call "a Primicorn" -- but it's used incorrectly. In fact, it's used exactly as if it were logically _not_ a Primicorn!
  
How can this be? How can we both wrap exactly the same symbols in an existential proposition, and get different answers back, so to speak?
  
First a pedantic note, using the metaphor: we do both get the same answer. The answer to _every_ existential question is "Yes and no," which means "Yes, those symbols exist somewhere; and no, they don't exist somewhere, too."
  
But the metaphor is poor, so the pedantic interpretation above isn't as discouraging as it may seem. In fact, we never get any direct answers to our queries against Reality. Instead, Reality presents us with a landscape full of stones, which we occasionally trip over -- or walk up to and kick, if we're brave enough. And after we do -- assuming we survive the ordeal -- we get a shock, and start thinking. And we get our fellow mind-bodies to do the same, so we can watch and then compare notes on our experiences. And we start to form theories about the stone; and so on...
  
In the case of the (not-)Primicorn, the theory precedes the kick. (Which is the normal order for humans.) But the question remains: did Reality somehow misinterpret the symbols when our friend invoked them, versus when we did, so that they were granted access to the opposite meaning than intended? Emphatically: no, Reality does not interpret our symbols, nor our meanings.
  
Rather, the existential proposition is one of our footholds in Reality, which we liberally employ to form elaborate what-if and if-then theories about it. At some point, we then march up to the stone and, equipped with a vast existential web of concepts, pour a mixture of hydrochloric/nitric acid onto it, collect and process the resultant chloroauric acid, and walk away with gold.
  
Given all this, we may then ask what is special about existential propositions, when even if we do employ them as cornerstones of our theories, Reality itself seems to ignore their meaning altogether?
  
Indeed, this is the pivotal point: the symbols, the concepts, the propositions, the relations, the theories, ..., every bit of it exists in Reality. Reality contains every permutation of every symbol of every (alien) language; and all their associated meanings in every (alien) mind, as relationships between the symbols and the minds and an infinity of other `Things`.
  
When we form an existential proposition of some concept, we are not querying Reality as we might use some standard language to query a database. Instead, we are grabbing hold of a stone -- an abstract stone, but no less a `Thing` for it -- and _feeling_ its connectedness to other `Things`. It is akin to the function of any sensory organ we posses. The difference, for humans anyway, is that we expend a tremendous amount of time/energy/_effort_ using and interpreting the sensory organ we call consciousness.
  
This seems fair, considering that we are transmuting the stones that every other life form we know about has only tripped over, blindly.
  
# Summary
  
- Every `Thing` exists, from every illogical thought we've had, to every tree we've climbed.
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinite space of `Things`, where every proposition about them is true **and** false.
- Every `Thing` exists, in some subspaces of Reality.
- Every `Thing` does not exist, in some subspaces of Reality.
- The Platonic world, physical world, psychological world, etc., are all perspectives on an underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
