- TODO: Level
- TODO: Experience
- TODO: Ability Point (AP)
- TODO: Ability Tree
- Path
  - Ten of the twelve paths start by embracing one of the archetypes
    - May only begin upon attaining level 0, 4, or 8
    - Always start at T<sub>0</sub>
    - Through experience and special accomplishments, characters may advance along their paths to unlock higher tiers
  - The remaining two paths start by embracing one of the anti-archetypes
    - May only begin upon attaining level 0, 4, or 8
    - Must be the character's sole path. All existing paths must be entirely abandoned prior to embracing an anti-archetype
    - Starts at Tier T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, or T<sub>2</sub> if begun when level 0, 4, or 8, respectively
    - Through experience and special accomplishments, characters may advance along their paths to unlock higher tiers
- Tier
    - Represents the degree of mastery and accomplishment along a chosen path
- Specialization
    - The process of reaching higher Tiers of an archetype
    - Lower Tiers typically require increasing experience along a path, until mastery is achieved. Then, to reach higher Tiers, a character must accomplish worthy feats, and even contribute seminal advancements to their path
