# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Every existential proposition of a logically self-consistent thing `Thing` implies that `Thing` exists, or that `Thing` does not exist.  
- Every extant `Thing` is an implication of an existential proposition.
  
### [2] Principle of Self-Instantiation
  
- Existential propositions, such as this, exist.
  
### [3] Principle of Unbiased Implications
  
- Every self-consistent proposition is (somewhere) true _**and**_ (somewhere) false.
- Every other proposition is (everywhere) false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the space of all propositions, and their implications in accordance with [3].
  
# Exposition
  
- Let the string `Thing` mean any logically self-consistent thing, where "thing" is taken as broadly as possible.
  
Here, `Thing` encompasses "Platonic" concepts such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" concepts such as a proton, or a cat; and "meta-physical" concepts, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such things are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it does not make sense in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an inconsistent existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is everywhere false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is, in principle, unobtainable.
  
- Let the string template __T<sub>s</sub>__ mean any given instance of a `Thing`, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
 

In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T<sub>j</sub>__, within some arbitrary subspace of Reality. 
Here, either no other thing exists, or an arbitrary number of other things exist. 
For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in the former case, but this is not a necessary assumption.
  
- Let the string `universe` mean some such subspace of Reality.
  
- Let the string __∃(T)__ indicate the existential proposition of some `Thing` __T__.

- Here, we've considered four existential propositions, and can see the structure of Reality that they, together, imply.  
- The subspace of Reality corresponding to 1.1.1.1. contains (at least) four extant Things.
- Note that the 1.1.1.1. subspace is exactly one sixteenth of the total combinatorial space implied by the four propositions, but it is also the _densest_, in the sense that it contains more extant Things than any of the other fifteen subspaces.  
- As an example, we may take __T<sub>j</sub>__ and __T<sub>k</sub>__ to be points within some geometry, __T<sub>jk</sub>__ to be some relationship between them (e.g. "non-identical"), and __T<sub>0</sub>__ to be the number one.

# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinitely divisible space of propositions and their implications.
- Every logically possible `Thing` exists. _TODO ^_
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on the underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
