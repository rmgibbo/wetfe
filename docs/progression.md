# Intro
- Typically, characters start with no levels or experience.
- TODO: Level
- TODO: Experience
- TODO: Ability Point (AP)
- TODO: Ability Tree
- Path
  - Ten of the twelve paths start by choosing to embrace one of the archetypes
    - May only be chosen at levels 0, 4, and 8
    - Always start at Tier 0
    - Through experience and special accomplishments, characters may specialize in their archetypes to unlock higher Tiers
  - The remaining two paths start by choosing to embrace the anti-archetype
    - May only be chosen at level 0, 4, or 8
    - Must be the character's sole path. Any existing paths must be entirely abandoned upon choosing to follow the anti-archetype
    - Starts at Tier 0, 1, or 2 if chosen at level 0, 4, or 8, respectively
    - Through experience and special accomplishments, characters may specialize in the anti-archetypes to unlock higher Tiers
- Tier
    - Represents the degree of mastery and accomplishment along a chosen path
- Specialization
    - The process of reaching higher Tiers of an archetype
    - Lower Tiers typically require increasing experience along a path, until mastery is achieved. Then, to reach higher Tiers, a character must accomplish worthy feats, and even contribute seminal advancements to their path
