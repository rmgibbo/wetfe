## Axioms of Reality
  
#### Principle of the Existential Thing
- Every self-consistent existential proposition implies that a Thing exists, or that it does not exist.  
- Every extant Thing is an implication of a self-consistent existential proposition.
  
#### Principle of Unbiased Reality
- Every self-consistent proposition is true _**and**_ false.  
- Reality is the combinatorial space of the implications of all self-consistent propositions.
  
## Cases
In each case below, let us begin at some arbitrary place in Reality. That is, let us being by considering the implications of the self-consistent existential proposition of some Thing T<sub>j</sub>. At each such place in Reality, either no other Thing exists, or an arbitrary number of other Things exist. For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in the former case, though the results are completely general.
  
#### T<sub>j</sub> exists &rarr;
1. Reality contains the existence of T<sub>j</sub>
2. Reality contains the nonexistence of T<sub>j</sub>
  
#### T<sub>j</sub> exists and T<sub>k</sub> exists &rarr;
1. Reality contains the existence of T<sub>j</sub>

- Here, we've considered four existential propositions, and can see the structure of Reality that they, together, imply.  
- The subspace of Reality corresponding to 1.1.1.1. (or 1.i.a.a.) contains (at least) four extant Things.
- Note that the 1.1.1.1. subspace is exactly one sixteenth of the total combinatorial space implied by the four propositions, but it is also the _densest_, in the sense that it contains more extant Things than any of the other fifteen subspaces.  
- The natures of T<sub>j</sub>, T<sub>k</sub>, T<sub>jk</sub>, and T<sub>0</sub> set constraints on where our arbitrary starting place may appear in the greater structure of Reality.  
- As an example, we may take T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>k</sub> to be points within some geometry, T<sub>jk</sub> to be some relationship between them (e.g. "non-identical"), and T<sub>0</sub> to be the number one.

## Consequences
- No Thing is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every Thing is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinite bifurcating affine tree of existential implications.
- Every logically possible Thing exists. TODO!
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on the underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
