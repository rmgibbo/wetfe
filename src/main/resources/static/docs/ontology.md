# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Everything that exists, such as this string, is a `Thing`.
- Every `Thing` is the implication of an existential proposition.
- Existential propositions are `Things`.
  
### [2] Principle of Pre-Instantiation
  
- Every `Thing` exists.
  
### [3] Principle of Non-Exclusive Implication
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is true _**and**_ false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the exclusive space of all `Things` in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Terms
  
_concept_, _**c**_  
: Anything whose existence is proposed, in the broadest sense. Zero-dimensional points, second-order logic systems, biological evolution, a God that can/not move its own creation, non-trivial factorizations of prime numbers, etc., are all _concepts_.  
  
`Thing`, __T__  
: Anything that exists.
  
existence  
: The state of being within Reality. This is true of something iff it is a `Thing`.
  
existential proposition, `EXP`  
: The proposition of a _concept_ _**c**_ that comprehensively implies that _**c**_ exists if true, and that _**c**_ does not exist if false.
  
∃(_**c**_)  
: The existential proposition of some _concept **c**_  .
  
∃(__T__)  
: The existential proposition of some `Thing` __T__.
  
`Realm`  
: Any subspace of Reality, which contains zero or more (likely uncountably infinite) number of `Things`.
  
# Exposition
  
### Reality, The Thing
  
The relationship that Reality has with itself is unclear. We could take Reality to _not_ be a `Thing`, or to be a `Thing` that is like a subset is to itself, or to be a `Thing` that is within Reality like any other `Thing`; and in any case we would be consistent with the axioms given here.
  
Accordingly, this axiomatization makes no attempt to explain _why_ or _how_ Reality does exist. Instead, it attempts to provide a framework for explaining how the Human mind (and any other `Thing` possessing similar consciousness) has gained a foothold in Reality, whence it may start exploring its environment.
  
### Things vs Concepts
  
...
  
_TODO: Rewrite {_
  
The strict subset of _concepts_ that are `Things` encompasses "Platonic" _concepts_ such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" _concepts_ such as a photon, or a cat; and "meta-physical" _concepts_, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such _concepts_ are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it is contradictory in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is exclusively false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is unknown.
  
In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some _concept_, within some `Realm`.
(For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in an empty subspace of Reality, but this is not a necessary assumption.)
  
_TODO: }_
  
### Recursion
  
We may consider the `EXP` _"The existential proposition of itself exists."_
  
By [1], the `EXP` ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists.
  
Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition __T<sub>0</sub>__, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = __T<sub>0</sub>__ = ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__).
  
This construction holds for the symbols and the (standard) meanings behind them, and is consistent with the axioms. In fact, [1] _requires_ that every `Thing` and its `EXP` expand into an infinite composition like so, though only ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__) is completely self-similar.
  
We might note that Reality seems to brook the concepts of "recursion", "equality", and "infinity"; and we may wonder if they aren't `Things` as well... 
  
### The Primicorn
  
Let _**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_ mean the non-trivial factorization of a prime number.
  
Now, we may consider the `EXP` ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_), which says _"The non-trivial factorization of a prime number exists."_
  
By [1], ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) exists.
  
Then by [3], ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) is true, at least somewhere in Reality, and _poof!_ it seems we've summoned a Primicorn.
  
Unfortunately, although Primicorns _may_ exist, this "summoning" is not what it seems, for two reasons.
  
First, by [2], Primicorns either do not exist at all, or they do (somewhere) and -- like all `Things` -- are _discovered_, not summoned. 
  
Second, the fact that ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) is true does _not_ imply that the _concept_ of a Primicorn exists.
  
It implies that (somewhere, for instance _here_) the string _"The non-trivial factorization of a prime number"_ exists.
...

_TODO: Rewrite {_
  
How can we be sure that Primicorns, in fact, do not exist?
  
We cannot. We cannot, whether or not we had a friend strongly advocating for their existence.
  
All the axioms tell us is:  
- __If__ the proposed concept of a Primicorn is "logically self-consistent," then our friend has discovered a `Thing`, and we can be sure that it exists in some subspaces of Reality.  
- __Otherwise__, our friend _does not_ have a logical concept in mind, but instead the existential proposition of an arbitrary permutation of symbols, which does exist, but is exclusively false.
  
The fundamental issue is, of course, that we have no method of determining what concepts are "logically self-consistent" a priori. And then, even if we were so equipped, we have no method of determining what the nature and extent of our `Realm` is, again a priori. In both cases, however, propositions of concepts (i.e. theories) and experimentation shall avail us.

# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinite space of extant logical concepts, partitionable into subspaces called `Realms`.
- Reality does not contain itself.
- Every `Thing` exists, in some `Realms`.
- Every `Thing` does not exist, in some `Realms`.
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on an underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
