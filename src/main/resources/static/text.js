    iCOMMON_CALENDAR_BIRTHDAY: 'The first number is the estimated (using a standardized method) \
  number of petaseconds (quadrillions of seconds) that have elapsed since the Confluence, measured in proper time. \
  The second number is a logarithmic scalar that attempts to account for the difference between \
  local (proper) clocks and those of the Common Reference Frame, as well as the problem of simultaneity. \
  E.g., the farther away you were (at your birth) deemed to be from the CRF, the larger this scalar will be. \
  Large ~scalar values therefore represent a relative ambiguity in the first number; \
  and a ~scalar of 0.0 indicates beings born precisely within the CRF.',

    iCOMMON_CALENDAR_AGE: 'Calculated using a standardized method, this number is meant to \
  represent the number of seconds a being living constantly in the CRF would have \
  experienced (in CRF time) during <em>your</em> life (as accounted by your proper age). \
  There is necessarily a -- potentially extreme -- amount of ambiguity in such a calculation, \
  and thus this age is used as a rough guide to understanding alien beings.',
