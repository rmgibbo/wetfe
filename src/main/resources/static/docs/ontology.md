_concept_  
: Anything eligible for existence, in the broadest sense. Zero-dimensional points, second-order logic systems, biological evolution, a God that can/not move its own creation, non-trivial factorizations of prime numbers, the phrase _"xa;lk3@ j94p jf00*0;-+j2y4jd fje]"_, etc., are all _concepts_.  
: _TODO: More formally, this may be defined as all permutations of the characters of the alphabet of some suitably universal language._
  
_**c<sub>s</sub>**_  
: An instance of some _concept_, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
logically self-consistent
: A property that every _concept_ either has, or does not have. This is not a decidable property, in general, with extant Human theory.
  
`Thing`  
: A logically self-consistent _concept_.
  
__T<sub>s</sub>__  
: An instance of some `Thing`, where "__<sub>s</sub>__" is any string that helps identify the instance.
  
existence  
: A _concept_ exists iff its existential proposition is a `Thing`.
  
existential proposition, `EXP`  
: The proposition of a _concept_ _**c<sub>s</sub>**_ that comprehensively implies that _**c<sub>s</sub>**_ exists when it is true, and that _**c<sub>s</sub>**_ does not exist when it is false.

Reality  
: The exclusive container of every extant _concept_.
  
`Realm`  
: Some partition of Reality, which contains zero or more (likely uncountably infinite) number of extant _concepts_.
  
# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- The only _concepts_ that exist are existential propositions and `Things`.
- Every `Thing` is the implication of a true existential proposition.
  
### [2] Principle of Auto-Instantiation
  
- An existential proposition exists for every _concept_.
  
### [3] Principle of Unbiased Implications
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is true _**and**_ false. Every other proposition is exclusively false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the exclusive space of all existential propositions and their implications in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Exposition
  
### Reality Is Not a `Thing`
  
Reality is not logically self-consistent since it contains contradictory truth assignments for every logically self-consistent existential proposition.
  
Therefore, by definition, Reality is not a `Thing`.
  
Reality is also not an existential proposition.
  
Therefore by [1], sensationally, Reality does not exist. Of course, it does exist in a primal sense, but not by the definition used here, which would require that Reality contains itself (as an extant _concept_).
  
Accordingly, this "axiomatization of Reality" makes no attempt to explain _why_ or _how_ Reality does exist. Nor, even, how the crux of it works -- how the "logically self-consistent" property is crucially applied to the subset of _concepts_, to produce what we here call `Things`. Perhaps one day we will know, but for now the thrill of discovery and pursuit of explanation shall suffice!
  
### Things
  
The (strict) subset of _concepts_, or `Things`, encompasses "Platonic" _concepts_ such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" _concepts_ such as a photon, or a cat; and "meta-physical" _concepts_, such as aesthetics, or economics... as long as such _concepts_ are logically self-consistent.
  
For example, the non-trivial factorization of a prime number is not a `Thing`, because it is contradictory in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an existential proposition __that exists in Reality__, but is not a `Thing`, implicates no `Thing`, and is exclusively false.
  
A general method of determining the "logical self-consistency" of some thing _a priori_ is unknown.
  
In each case below, we begin by considering the implications of the existential proposition of some _concept_, within some `Realm`.
(For the sake of simplicity, we can imagine we're in an empty subspace of Reality, but this is not a necessary assumption.)
  
### __T<sub>0</sub>__
  
We may first consider the `EXP` _"This existential proposition exists."_
  
(Note that this is equivalent to _"An existential proposition of itself exists."_)
  
By [2] or [4], we know that the _concept_ ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists.
  
Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition _**c<sub>0</sub>**_, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = _**c<sub>0</sub>**_ = ∃(_**c<sub>0</sub>**_).
  
Now by [3], because _**c<sub>0</sub>**_ exists, ∃(_**c<sub>0</sub>**_) is somewhere true, and therefore ∃(_**c<sub>0</sub>**_) = _**c<sub>0</sub>**_ is a `Thing`.
  
We should now call it ∃(∃(∃(...))) = __T<sub>0</sub>__ = ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__).
  
We should also note that this infinite expansion of existential propositions is common to every one of them, though only __T<sub>0</sub>__ is completely self-similar.
  
### The Primicorn
  
Let _**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_ mean the non-trivial factorization of a prime number.
  
Now, we may consider the `EXP` ∃(_**g<sub>Primcorn</sub>**_), which says _"The non-trivial factorization of a prime number exists."_
  
Note that by [2], ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) exists.
  
In an effort to instantiate the primicorn itself, we may also put forth the `EXP` ∃(∃(_**g<sub>Primcorn</sub>**_)), which says "The existential proposition of the non-trivial factorization of a prime number exists."
  
By [2], this second proposition also exists.
  
So by [3], ∃(∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_)) is a `Thing` because it is somewhere true.

But, unlike in the case of __T<sub>0</sub>__, this does not then imply that ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) is a `Thing`, since it is a distinct _concept_ from ∃(∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_)).

# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinitely partitionable space of extant _concepts_.
- Every `Thing` exists. _TODO ^_
- Platonic reality, physical reality, psychological reality, etc., are all perspectives on an underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
