# The Myth
  
## Child Cosmos
  
Reality. A mind-numbingly vast and alien domain, teeming with an infinite variety of subspaces, each known as a realm, or a cosmos. Sufficiently rich subspaces of Reality permit phenomena, and even physics, to emerge from the denizens of different realms. Within one such space, three realms have intermixed with each other. And of this confluence, a new cosmos has been wrought. It is a child cosmos, born of an eclectic, supremely special, yet cohesive mixture of its parents’ properties:
  
## Celestial Realm
  
From one of its cosmic parents, known to some as the Celestial Realm, or the Bitsphere, it inherits the geometry of its three spatial dimensions, and the invariant mass field that permeates it. Thus, it is imbued with structures that admit highly distinct regions of matter-space, and vast amounts of information.
  
## Infernal Realm
  
From another parent cosmos, known to some as the Infernal Realm, or the Chronosphere, it acquires the geometry of its temporal dimension, which manifests as the Arrow of Time that induces asymmetric thermodynamic processes. Thus, the emergent systems of mass-energy within the child cosmos inexorably climb to ever-higher entropy states, thereby obscuring information and driving the macrocosm toward thermal equilibrium.
  
## Exotic Realm
  
From its final cosmic progenitor, known to some as the Exotic Realm, or the Queersphere, it acquires its quantum and multiversal nature: the spacetime manifold and stress-energy-momentum tensor begotten of the mixture between the Celestial and Infernal Realms are quantized, and "smeared" across an infinity of loosely-coupled parallel dimensions.  
  
## Confluent Realm
Thus formed, the child cosmos is imbued with the ingredients necessary to exhibit a wealth of emergent physics and phenomena. And so they did emerge: particles, gravity, chemistry, biology; and eventually social consciousness, which gradually became aware of these phenomena, and then of the cosmos itself, and then even of its progenitors...
