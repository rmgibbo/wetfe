# Axioms of Reality
  
### [1] Principle of the Existential Thing
  
- Everything that exists, such as this string, is a `Thing`.
- Every `Thing` is the implication of an existential proposition.
- Existential propositions are `Things`.
  
### [2] Principle of Pre-Instantiation
  
- Every `Thing` exists.
  
### [3] Principle of Non-Exclusive Implication
  
- Every proposition that is a `Thing` is true _**and**_ false.
  
### [4] Definition of Reality
  
- Reality is the exclusive space of all `Things` in accordance with [1], [2], and [3].
  
# Terms
  
_concept_, _**c**_  
: Anything whose existence is proposed, in the broadest sense. Zero-dimensional points, second-order logic systems, biological evolution, a God that can/not move its own creation, non-trivial factorizations of prime numbers, etc., are all _concepts_.  
  
`Thing`, __T__  
: Anything that exists.
  
existence  
: The state of being within Reality. This is true of something iff it is a `Thing`.
  
existential proposition, `EXP`  
: The proposition of a _concept_ _**c**_ that comprehensively implies that _**c**_ exists if true, and that _**c**_ does not exist if false.
  
∃(_**c**_)  
: The existential proposition of some _concept **c**_  .
  
∃(__T__)  
: The existential proposition of some `Thing` __T__.
  
`Realm`  
: Any subspace of Reality, which contains zero or more (likely uncountably infinite) number of `Things`.
  
# Exposition
  
### Reality, The Thing?
  
The relationship that Reality has with itself is unclear. We could take Reality to _not_ be a `Thing`, and "exist" in some sense other than our working definition. Or, we could take Reality to be a `Thing` that is like a subset is to itself, or to be a `Thing` that is within Reality like any other `Thing`; and in any case we would be consistent with the axioms given here.
  
Accordingly, this axiomatization makes no attempt to explain _why_ or _how_ Reality does exist. Instead, it attempts to provide a framework for explaining how the Human mind (and any other `Thing` possessing similar consciousness) has gained a foothold in Reality, whence it may start exploring its environment more efficiently than by kicking stones.
  
### Things vs Concepts
  
All _concepts_ are, in the literal sense, `Things`. Still, the distinction between the two is useful for two reasons.
  
First, _concepts_ appeal to the human-like perception of `Things`. While all `Things` and only `Things` exist, including anything our minds may conjure up, _concepts_ are the `Things` that they _have_ conjured up -- or rather, discovered.
  
Second, _concepts_ are always a permutation of symbols, but only _sometimes_ have meaning. And it is the symbols and their permutations that certainly exist, and therefore why all _concepts_ are `Things`. However, we're rarely interested in the permutation of symbols themselves when we form existential propositions of them.
  
What we're really after is the existence of the _meaning_ of the symbols.
  
So, what does it mean, for symbols to "have meaning"?
  
First of all, it is important to note that whatever these "meanings" that _concepts_ may have are, they are nothing mystical, and nothing anthropomorphic. They are simply `Things` in Reality, like everything else. Specifically, they are a subspace of `Things` that are more or less intimately related to the symbol-`Things` that compose the perspective of the _concept_ as proposed.
  
Meaningful _concepts_ then, are rich subspaces of related `Things`. (These relationships themselves are, of course, also `Things`.)
  
On the other hand, if some _concept_ we have in mind is not very meaningful, then it exists relatively "alone" in Reality, with few other `Things` that reference it.
  
Thus, _concepts_ encompass "Platonic" entities such as the number one, or a Euclidean circle; and "physical" entities such as a photon, or a cat; and "meta-physical" entities, such as aesthetics, or economics; and all of these are `Things`. And they all have a sort of "meaningfulness metric," related to how highly connected they are to other `Things`.
  
For example, the _concept_ of a _"non-trivial factorization of a prime number"_ is unlikely to be very meaningful, since it is contradictory in its own terms.
Therefore, _"The non-trivial factorization of the number five exists."_ is an existential proposition of a _concept_ that exists like any other `Thing`, but likely as a mere permutation of symbols in a sparsely-connected corner of Reality.
  
(I suspect that even "sparsely-connected" `Things` are related to an uncountable infinity of other `Things`. The theory of infinite cardinals/ordinals should be necessary, at least, to begin explaining the "connectedness" of `Things` within Reality.)
  
### Recursion
  
We may consider the `EXP` _"The existential proposition of itself exists."_
  
By [1], the `EXP` ∃(∃(∃(...))) exists.
  
Let's call this infinitely recursive existential proposition __T<sub>0</sub>__, and note that ∃(∃(∃(...))) = __T<sub>0</sub>__ = ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__).
  
This construction holds for the symbols and the (standard) meanings behind them, and is consistent with the axioms. In fact, [1] _requires_ that every `Thing` and its `EXP` expand into an infinite composition like so, though only ∃(__T<sub>0</sub>__) is completely self-similar.
  
We might note that Reality seems to brook the concepts of "recursion", "equality", and "infinity"; and we may wonder if they aren't `Things` as well... 
  
### The Primicorn
  
Let _**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_ mean _"the non-trivial factorization of a prime number"_.
  
Now, we may consider the `EXP` ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_), which says _"The non-trivial factorization of a prime number exists."_
  
By [1], ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) exists.
  
Then by [3], ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) is true, at least somewhere in Reality, and _poof!_ it seems we've summoned a Primicorn.
  
Unfortunately, although Primicorns _may_ exist, this "summoning" is not what it seems, for two reasons.
  
First, by [2], Primicorns either do not exist at all, or they do (somewhere) and -- like all `Things` -- are _discovered_, not summoned.
  
Second, the fact that ∃(_**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_) is true does _not_ imply that the _meaning_ of _**c<sub>Primicorn</sub>**_ exists.
  
It implies that (somewhere in Reality, for instance _here_) the string _"the non-trivial factorization of a prime number"_ exists. And, in this case at least, likely not much else.
  
### The Primicorn, Again
  
_TODO: Refactor {_
  {{The friend advocating for the Primicorn, and our inability to prove, or decide, a prior whether it's a meaningful concept is still relevant here.}}

The fundamental issue is, of course, that we have no method of determining how "meaningful" _concepts_ are a priori. And then, even if we were so equipped, we have no method of determining what the nature and extent of our `Realm` is, again a priori. In both cases, however, propositions of concepts (i.e. theories), critique, and experimentation shall avail us.  
  
_TODO: }_
  
### Time

{{First-person: construct some "toy" subspace of Reality from the principles.}}
  
# Consequences
  
- No `Thing` is absolutely fundamental, nor absolutely emergent.
- Every `Thing` is relatively fundamental, and relatively emergent.
- Reality is a "multiverse" -- an infinite space of `Things`, partitionable into subspaces called `Realms`.
- Every `Thing` exists, in some `Realms`.
- Every `Thing` does not exist, in some `Realms`.
- The Platonic world, physical world, psychological world, etc., are all perspectives on an underlying Reality, which implies all of them.
